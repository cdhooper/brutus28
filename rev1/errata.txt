The STM32 can't shut off PLD VCC if jumper is set to 5V. This is because
    the pull-up for EN_VCC gets clipped by the STM32 internal gate protection
    diode down to 3.3V. This causes the BSS84 to turn on. Place an N-channel
    MOSFET in front of it.
    Rework: View PCB bottom. Orient PCB so silkscreen text is right-side up.
            Locate first horizontal above the "By" text. This trace starts at a
            via, goes to the right, and then turns no degrees to head toward
            the close edge of the board.
            1. Cut this trace, creating a gap.
            2. Solder the middle leg (3 drain) of a BSS138 to the left side
               of the cut trace (this leads to the gate of Q1.
            3. Solder right leg (2 source) to the GND plane.
            4. Connect a wire from the left leg (1 gate) to the right side
               of the cut trace (EN_VCC this leads to STM32 PB5).
    Fixed in Rev 2

Decrease PLD current limit resistor (currently 22 Ohm) to something like
    10 Ohm. With 22 Ohm and GAL installed, voltage is about 3.6V.
    Fixed in Rev 2 - Will use 2x 22 Ohm resistors in parallel

Add hole under center of TH PLCC socket for easier removal
    Fixed in Rev 2

Add pin numbers next to DIP socket
    Fixed in Rev 2

Add optional LED row, one for each pin of tested device
    Fixed in Rev 2

Add PLCC-20 socket and wide DIP socket
    Fixed in Rev 2
