The STM32 can't shut off PLD VCC if jumper is set to 5V. This is because
    the pull-up for EN_VCC gets clipped by the STM32 internal gate protection
    diode down to 3.3V. This causes the BSS84 to turn on. Place an N-channel
    MOSFET in front of it.

Decrease PLD current limit resister (currently 22 Ohm) to something like
    10 Ohm. With 22 Ohm and GAL installed, voltage is about 3.6V.

Add hole under center of TH PLCC socket for easier removal
