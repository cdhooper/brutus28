Individual pin LEDs are too bright. Maybe switch from 2.2K resistors to 4.7K.
    Current work-around is to replace LEDs jumper with a 470 Ohm resistor.

Dual 22 Ohm resistors R13 and R14 limit PLD voltage too much.
    Switch to 250mA polyfuse (PPTC)

Wide DIP socket (P2) label overlays pin text

PLD sockets are too close to DIP sockets for ZIF to be used
